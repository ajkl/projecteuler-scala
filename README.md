# projecteuler-scala

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a good way to understand the power of a new language. 
It might not give you a good feel of the object oriented powers of the language but you will definitely code better computational models as you progress in the PE problem set. At least thats what I have found to be useful.

Every problem solution is an individual scala worksheet.
I have used ScalaIDE for Eclipse for these, which can be found at http://scala-ide.org/
These solutions might be dirty and hacky at times.
